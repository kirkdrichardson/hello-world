# hello-world

In August, I will begin a 3-month period of concentrated study. My purpose is to obtain the fundamental skillset of a jr. full-stack web developer. This programmer's log will chart my experiences with the technolgies, their accompanying frustrations, and the daily victories of language, logic, and dumb luck. I will be using vim to write, and a local branch to push entries.



July will be a month of preparation. My main intention is to familiarize myself with the various tools of professional development work, learn how to merge the front- and back-ends of a project, and continue translating ideas of particular interest into javascript. I have some previous background in developing websites for my own purposes, although the ones I've built from scratch are limited by my programming abilities and knowledge of frameworks. In graduate school, I used Python to collect and manipulate the data I used for my MS thesis, but the project deadlines limited my ability to go deeper into programming. Having just completed my degree and the contract work I was doing for a non-profit finance organization, I am gifting myself with these months of uninterrupted learning and personal growth.


Also tabled for completion in July is a curriculum, and links to resources frequented.
