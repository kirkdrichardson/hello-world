>In August, I will begin a 3-month period of concentrated study. My purpose is to obtain the fundamental skillset of a jr. full-stack web developer. I will be following the curriculum of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as a primary resource. This programmer's log will chart my experiences with the technolgies, their accompanying frustrations, and the daily victories of language, logic, and dumb luck. I will be using vim to write, and a local branch to push entries.

>July will be a month of preparation. My main intention is to familiarize myself with the various tools of professional development work, learn how to merge the front- and back-ends of a project, and continue translating ideas of particular interest into javascript. I have some previous background in developing websites for my own purposes, although the ones I've built from scratch are limited by my programming abilities and knowledge of frameworks. In graduate school, I used Python to collect and manipulate the data I used for my MS thesis, but the project deadlines limited my ability to go deeper into programming. Having just completed my degree and the contract work I was doing for a non-profit finance organization, I am gifting myself with these months of uninterrupted learning and personal growth.


>Also tabled for completion in July is a curriculum, and links to resources frequented.

>Today I began cleaning the Python scripts I used in my Thesis. Now that I understand Github, the power of it is amazing. Although I don't have a strong need to control the versions of my scripts & associated data, it has been fun to work in the terminal & push to Github. Really, everything in the terminal is so much easier once the task to be achieved becomes familiar. Using graphics mode requires you, first, to find every element necessary to the success of a goal. While shortcuts enable a savvy user to mititgate this necessity, the reduction in time and effort is only partial. Many shortcuts also do not work across applicatons, and macros remain local to a machine. 

>The terminal, then, is a sort of salvation. The need to find objects in order to complete a task is limited only by an understanding of file structure. The same series of executed commands accumulated on a trip to a chrome browser, to Github, to a repository, to a particular file can be replicated in the terminal with more concision and elegance. 

>Applied to the entire internet and complete file structure of the accessing machine, the terminal becomes a space of imagination powered by knowledge. It is a global playground where the rules of user interface don't apply.

>Finished compiling & editing the data supplement to my thesis on Github yesterday. I was working to consolidate folders & files in a location separate from my repository clone. This was primarily due to data dependencies of the Python scripts that would have required moving many files only to delete them from the working tree once consolidated. The lesson I learned is that Github is worth using, always. I permanently deleted the completed scripts shortly after finishing... I want to blame it on Jupyter's interface (the practical shutdown tab next to the rarely used (permanent) delete), but I was rushing the close of what had taken days. It's on me. Just before diving into Chrome's browser cache to attempt to begin parsing the files for segments of my scripts, I calmed, checked the app data, and restored from an earlier checkpoint. *Lesson learned.*

>Currently researching the Wordpress JSON API for a new project. More forthcoming.

>Continuing to explore the DOM, Ajax, JQuery, and CORS. The internet is a fascinating place.

>Progressing on my ability to manipulate the DOM usng JS & learning more about HTTP, TCP, and Unix systems.

>Wrapping up a thorough introduction to JQuery today. I'm eager to begin building, but I also want to take the time to understand the foundational technology of the tools I'm using. I'll do my best to balance input with output without dropping below a productivity threshold that I'll officially define before August.

>Tonight is the eve of my official start. I haven't tended to this log much this month, but I've been building and learning. I completed the first three basic projects: a [random quote machine](https://codepen.io/kconfig/pen/MoqNVW), a [weather app](https://codepen.io/kconfig/pen/dRwWBe), and a [Wikipedia search app](https://codepen.io/kconfig/pen/xLZBvL). I have one more basic project before starting the intermediate algorithms. I'm looking forward to getting back into more direct problem solving, although the apps have been a milestone. My understanding of how development works is much sharper. I know now that with enough research, I can build some pretty cool things, much cooler than what I've already done. The steady growth of this mode of thinking is an exciting development.  Although the projects are of a small scale, they are a hill from which larger mountains can be glimpsed and contemplated. So, one more to go. Just a slightly higher hill.
